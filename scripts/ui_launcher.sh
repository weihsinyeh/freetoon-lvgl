# Toon UI launcher. Called by the `toon:345:respawn:` inittab row instead
# of running /mnt/data/toonui directly.
#
# Boot flow:
#   1. Run toonui in --bootpick mode (10 s picker screen with countdown).
#      It reads /mnt/data/ui_choice for the default selection.
#   2. Inspect the picker's exit code:
#        rc 0   → user picked / defaulted to freetoon → exec toonui normally
#        rc 99  → user picked / defaulted to qt-gui    → exec /qmf/sbin/qt-gui
#        rc *   → any other status (crash, missing binary, bootpick skipped
#                 because picker_enabled=0) → fall through to ui_choice
#
# This indirection keeps /etc/inittab stable across UI switches — flipping
# modes only writes /mnt/data/ui_choice, init never gets touched.
