# freetoon-lvgl

A from-scratch UI and integration stack for the **Eneco Toon 1 / Toon 2** smart
thermostat that runs entirely on the device — no cloud, no Quby login, no
subscription. The stock Qt UI is replaced with an LVGL app; a small constellation
of side processes brings the hardware back to life (boiler, P1 meter, vent,
weather, packages) and exposes everything over a tiny progressive web app so
you can also drive the house from your phone.

*9-frame loop pulled live from the device framebuffer at v0.7.4 —
home (live CV pressure, moon-phase widget) → dim ambient → boot
picker → buienradar radar → heater detail → schedule editor →
graphs → settings → lights.*

![Home screen](docs/screenshots/home.png)

![Boot picker](docs/screenshots/boot-picker.png)
*The 10-second picker every boot — pick `freetoon-lvgl` or `Stock qt-gui` and the device dispatches `inittab` accordingly. Same modal lives in Settings → UI mode for in-session switching.*

## Why

Eneco discontinued cloud support for the original Toon: no more app, no more
weather, no more package tracking, no more software updates. The device itself
is a perfectly capable iMX28 box with a 1024×600 touchscreen, an OpenTherm
adapter, an i.MX P1-meter UART and a humidity/temperature sensor — too good to
land on a shelf.

`freetoon-lvgl` keeps the thermostat doing what it's good at (running OpenTherm,
modulating the boiler, reading the room) while replacing the parts that
required a server somewhere:

| Lost piece | Replacement |
|---|---|
| Eneco cloud UI | LVGL app on the framebuffer + LVGL "dim" ambient screen |
| Mobile app | Self-hosted PWA served from the Toon itself |
| Weather forecast | Direct Buienradar pull |
| Energy graphs | P1 bridge → MQTT → Home Assistant (or local view) |
| Package tracking | IMAP-driven HA automation → MQTT → on-device banner |
| Ventilation control | Itho Wifi addon REST API integration |
| Schedule editor | Native LVGL screen + PWA editor |

## Screens

### Home
The default LVGL screen. Big tiles for the main signals — indoor temperature
and setpoint, boiler state (with the original-Toon-style radiator+flame icon
when CH is firing), waste-collection reminders, live energy + gas, ventilation
preset + RPM, water flow, curtains. A 5-day weather forecast lives at the
bottom. Tap the heater tile for OT detail; tap the gear-corner for settings.

![Home](docs/screenshots/home.png)

### Dim / ambient
After the configured idle timeout the screen drops to a near-black ambient
view: clock, indoor temperature with a small radiator+flame indicator when
the boiler is firing, vent fan spinner on the left mirroring the flame on
the right, top trash hint, top-right outdoor temperature, package banners
at the top, weather strip at the bottom.

![Dim](docs/screenshots/dim.png)

### Heater detail
Tap the heater tile from home to see boiler-side telemetry — flow + return
water temps, modulation level, CH setpoint from the stooklijn, water
pressure, eCO₂ / TVOC / humidity. The `Advanced` button opens a full dump
of every OpenTherm DataId currently tracked by OTGW.

### PWA
Served at `http://<toon>:10081/` from the device itself. Same controls as the
LVGL screen plus a packages list with manual entry and the weekly schedule
editor. Add to Home Screen for a phone-app feel; works offline-first via a
small service worker.

### Boot picker — escape hatch to stock qt-gui

Every boot opens a 10-second picker letting the user choose between
freetoon-lvgl and the original Eneco qt-gui. Default selection (the
highlighted tile) is whichever was used last; the countdown falls
through to that default. Same modal is reachable mid-session from
**Settings → UI mode**. This means the device is never "trapped" on
freetoon — anyone can switch back to stock qt-gui in seconds without
SSH access.

![Boot picker](docs/screenshots/boot-picker.png)

The picker writes `/mnt/data/ui_choice`; a small `ui_launcher.sh` is
the `inittab` `respawn:` target and dispatches to either
`/mnt/data/toonui` or `/qmf/sbin/qt-gui` based on that file. Companion
sidecars (`p1bridge`, `quby_bridge`, …) are wrapped by
`companion_gate.sh` which polls the same file so they idle quietly
when qt-gui is the active UI.

### Settings → Marketplace

Browse + one-tap install of third-party integrations from
[freetoon-integrations](https://github.com/Ierlandfan/freetoon-integrations).
Each integration is a small daemon that publishes data on BoxTalk; toonui
picks it up via its existing subscribe path, and Settings → Tiles binds any
installed integration to any home-tile slot.

**Want to build one?** See **[docs/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md)** —

C daemon, cross-compiling, and how to publish to the catalog.

```

`toonui` is the only new long-running process on the device. The stock
`qt-gui` is removed from `inittab` so it can't fight for the framebuffer;
`toonui` is added with `respawn` so init brings it back on crash. Config
lives at `/mnt/data/toonui.cfg`; logs go to `/var/volatile/tmp/toonui.log`.

## Install

Two paths: grab a pre-built **release** (no toolchain required), or build
from **source** if you want to hack on the code. Both use the same
`install.sh` script — it auto-detects which layout it's running in.

### Prerequisites (both paths)

* A Linux host with `bash`, `ssh`, `scp`, and `sshpass` on `PATH`
  (`apt-get install sshpass`).
* SSH enabled on the Toon — toggle from the stock `hcb_config` menu
  (Internals → SSH server). Default credentials are `root` / `toon`.
* `/mnt/data/` is writable on stock firmware; nothing to do there.
* A reachable MQTT broker is recommended (powers the packages banner
  and the energy/water logging path).
* Home Assistant is optional (drives curtains, Life360 location, push
  notifications) — set the LLAT in `/mnt/data/ha.cfg` after install.

### Path A — Use a release (recommended)

1. Grab the latest tarball from
   [Releases](https://github.com/Ierlandfan/freetoon-lvgl/releases) — pick
   `freetoon-lvgl-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`.

2. Extract somewhere on your Linux host:

   ```bash
   tar xzf freetoon-lvgl-v0.5.0.tar.gz
   cd freetoon-lvgl-v0.5.0
   ```

   The tarball contains:

   ```
   toonui                 # LVGL UI binary (ARMv7 hardfloat)
   p1bridge               # HomeWizard → hcb_rrd bridge
   quby_bridge            # (optional) Quby-protocol bridge to keteladapter
   ot_mode_switch.sh      # helper called by the on-device Settings UI
   pwa/                   # PWA static assets served on :10081
   install.sh             # the same script as in the repo
   ```

3. Run the installer against your Toon:

   ```bash
   TOON_HOST=192.168.3.212 \
   P1_TOKEN=<HomeWizard v2 bearer token> \
   VENT_USER=<Itho-Wifi user> VENT_PASS=<…> \
   ./install.sh
   ```

   The script scps every binary to `/mnt/data/`, writes
   `/mnt/data/p1bridge.conf` + `/mnt/data/vent.conf`, upserts the
   `toon` / `p1br` / `qbri` rows in `/etc/inittab`, then `kill -HUP 1`s
   init. After ~4 seconds it pgreps the new processes so you can see them
   running. Idempotent — re-run to upgrade.

4. (Optional) edit `/mnt/data/toonui.cfg` on-device — or open the
   Settings tile on the LVGL UI — to point at your MQTT broker, set the
   weather location, dial brightness/idle timeout, etc.

To uninstall: `./install.sh --uninstall` (drops inittab rows, kills
processes, removes binaries + PWA + configs).

### Path B — Build from source

Use this if you want to modify the UI or the bridges.

1. Clone the repo and grab the LVGL submodule:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ierlandfan/freetoon-lvgl.git
   cd freetoon-lvgl
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Cross-compile for ARMv7 hardfloat. The Makefile expects a Linaro
   toolchain at `/tmp/qt_rebuild/linaro/` (mirror of
   `gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz`). Adjust
   the path in the Makefiles if yours lives elsewhere.

   ```bash
   make -C lvgl_ui_recovered/src        # produces lvgl_ui_recovered/build/toonui
   make -C p1bridge                     # produces p1bridge/p1bridge
   make -C quby_bridge                  # produces quby_bridge/quby_bridge (optional)
   ```

   Native desktop build with the SDL2 driver is also wired up — useful
   for previewing UI changes without a Toon on the desk. See
   `lvgl_ui_recovered/src/Makefile` for the `sdl` target.

3. Deploy with the same script — it picks the in-tree build paths
   automatically:

   ```bash
   TOON_HOST=192.168.3.212 P1_TOKEN=… ./install.sh
   ```

Edit `lvgl_ui_recovered/src/settings.c` defaults or `/mnt/data/toonui.cfg`
on-device to point at your own IPs.

### Run `freetoon-lvgl` with SDL2 simulator in macOS and Linux
**Prerequisites**

macOS: `brew install sdl2`

Linux: `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`

**Build**
```bash
cd lvgl_ui_recovered/src
make TARGET=sim clean
make TARGET=sim all
```

**Run**
```bash
cd lvgl_ui_recovered/build-sim
./toonui-sim
```

## Status

The thermostat path is **the** path on this install — `happ_thermstat` →
`keteladapter` over the Quby protocol, with `quby_bridge` patched to mimic
the discontinued BoilerAdapter bit-for-bit. OTGW runs in GW=1 (relay) mode
and forwards the same OpenTherm frames the original BA produced, so the
boiler's CH/DHW state machines see no change from when Eneco's hardware was
in the loop. Verified by warming a 17.9 °C room to 20.0 °C unattended.

The repo is opinionated to one physical install (the author's), and parts
of the integration glue (HA entities, MQTT topic names, Itho user/password
location) are tuned to that environment. The LVGL UI and the core BoxTalk /
Quby / OTGW plumbing are portable; the per-integration screens are easy to
disable.

## Acknowledgements

`freetoon-lvgl` is an independent alternative UI by **Ierlandfan**. Special
thanks to **Quby / Eneco** for the underlying Toon platform and the BoxTalk /
Quby protocol structure this UI builds on.

* **OTGW** — Robert van den Breemen's HTTP-firmware fork of the OpenTherm
  Gateway is the boiler-side workhorse.
* **Itho Wifi** — Arjen Hiemstra's add-on board + REST API made vent control
  trivial.
* **HomeWizard** — open `/api/v1/data` on the HWE-P1 / HWE-WTR.

* **Toon community** — the reverse-engineering work scattered across
  hacktoon and various Tweakers threads that mapped out happ_thermstat,
  hcb_config and the Quby protocol.
